# **Bloop Design**

Welcome to the Bloop Design Repository! This repository is dedicated to our unique subscription-based platform, Bloop, that links authors and readers in a vibrant and immersive community. Bloop provides access to various versions of books and offers personal mentorship sessions with authors.

As we continue to grow and evolve, we're eager to collaborate with talented designers like you who can help shape the future of our application.

## **Our Vision**

Our goal is to transform the way people explore, understand, and dive into the world of literature. We envision Bloop as an immersive, intuitive, and engaging platform that will redefine the reading experience and author-reader interaction.

## **Pages**

Here are the pages that we have designed and they will be helpful for you in understanding the overall design of this application. You have to make it accordingly and if changes are required then you can suggest us and we will redesign it.
